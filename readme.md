# Workout Manager

My 'Workout Manager' helps users to plan gym workouts, track them and update. User also has an ability to set the goal, experience level and workout frequency.

To run this project on your computer:
1. Make sure all the packages from <requirements.txt> file are installed.
2. Create .env file in the root of the project with the following variables:
* DATABASE = <database_name>
* NAME = <db_username>
* PASSWORD = <db_password>
* HOSTNAME = <db_host>
* PORT = <db_port>
* NINJA_API_KEY = <you can ask me for mine or sign in to https://www.api-ninjas.com/api/exercises>

3. Execute init_db.py file to set up necessary tables.

4. **Now you can run the main.py file :)**
